  // The loop structure iterates over independent grid points (i, j, k) and a fixed dimension (m).
  // Analysis for OpenMP readiness:
  // 1. Data Dependencies: Each computation u[i][j][k][m] = u[i][j][k][m] + rhs[i][j][k][m]
  //    is independent of other (i', j', k', m') iterations. There are no loop-carried dependencies.
  // 2. Load Imbalance: The work per iteration (i, j, k, m) is constant. Parallelizing
  //    one of the outer loops (i, j, or k) using OpenMP will naturally distribute
  //    the workload evenly among threads, assuming grid_points dimensions are reasonably large.
  // 3. Synchronization Overhead: Writes are to distinct memory locations u[i][j][k][m]
  //    for different iterations. No shared data is modified concurrently by different
  //    parallel iterations of the outer loops, thus no synchronization is needed within
  //    the parallel loops.

  // This existing structure is already well-suited for adding efficient OpenMP pragmas
  // (e.g., on the 'i' loop for parallel processing of slices).
