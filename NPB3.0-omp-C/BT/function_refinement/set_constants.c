// Original function set_constants with added structure for potential OpenMP sections/tasks
static void set_constants(void) {

  /*
   * Refinement for Parallelism:
   * The original function is a sequence of assignments and calculations.
   * To prepare for OpenMP, we can structure this into logical groups
   * of statements that are either independent or have minimal dependencies
   * between groups. This allows the use of directives like #pragma omp sections
   * or #pragma omp task later.
   *
   * Data Dependencies: Statements within a group might have dependencies,
   * but ideally, dependencies between groups are minimized or follow a clear
   * flow (Group 2 depends on Group 1, etc.). For complex graphs, tasking
   * with dependencies is more suitable, but sections provide a basic structure.
   *
   * Load Imbalance: For this kind of initialization, static grouping might
   * lead to imbalance if sections have vastly different amounts of work.
   * Dynamic approaches like tasks are better for imbalance, but for simple
   * constants, overhead might dominate. Manual grouping by lines or variable
   * types is a starting point.
   *
   * Synchronization Overhead: By grouping statements and avoiding shared
   * writes to the *same* variable in different conceptual parallel sections,
   * synchronization is implicitly handled by the section/task completion.
   * No explicit locks are needed within this function's original logic.
