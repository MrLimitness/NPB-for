static void y_solve(void) {
  // This sequence of function calls (lhsy -> y_solve_cell -> y_backsubstitute)
  // typically represents successive steps in an algorithm with inherent data
  // dependencies, where the output or state modified by one function is
  // required by the next. Therefore, executing these calls sequentially
  // is usually necessary to maintain algorithmic correctness.

  // Refinement for adding efficient OpenMP primitives later should focus on
  // parallelizing the *internal operations* within each of these functions.
  // Each function (lhsy, y_solve_cell, y_backsubstitute) should be structured
  // to enable parallel execution of its independent computations.

  // 1. Data Dependencies:
  //    - Analyze the internal loops and operations within lhsy(), y_solve_cell(),
  //      and y_backsubstitute().
  //    - Identify loop-carried dependencies and restructure loops or algorithms
  //      where possible to make iterations independent.
  //    - Use techniques like privatization for thread-local data copies.
  //    - Understand shared data access patterns to minimize dependencies.

  // Perform Left-Hand Side calculations for Y.
  // OpenMP parallelism should be applied *within* the lhsy function,
  // parallelizing loops over computational domains (e.g., cells, points)
  // where calculations are independent.
  lhsy();

  // 2. Load Imbalance:
  //    - Within the parallel regions of the functions, analyze the workload
  //      of each parallel unit (e.g., loop iteration, task).
  //    - If workload varies significantly, consider dynamic or guided loop
  //      scheduling with OpenMP to ensure threads finish work around the same time.

  // Solve for Y variable, likely per computational cell or line.
  // This step depends on results from lhsy. Parallelism is typically
  // applied *within* y_solve_cell(), often across independent cells or lines
  // that can be solved simultaneously.
  y_solve_cell();

  // 3. Synchronization Overhead:
  //    - Within the parallel regions of the functions, identify shared data
  //      write operations.
  //    - Minimize the use and scope of critical sections, atomic operations,
  //      or explicit locks where possible.
  //    - Use OpenMP reduction clauses for common accumulation patterns (sum, min, max, etc.).
  //    - Design algorithms to reduce the need for explicit synchronization (e.g., using
  //      thread-local accumulation and a final sum).

  // Perform back-substitution for Y.
  // This step depends on results from y_solve_cell. While the back-substitution
  // loop itself has loop-carried dependencies, parallelism might be possible
  // *within* y_backsubstitute() across independent parts of the domain (e.g., lines),
  // or using specialized parallel backward sweep algorithms.
  y_backsubstitute();

  // The structure of calling these functions sequentially is preserved here
  // because it's dictated by data dependencies between the steps.
  // True parallelization effort lies in making the *internals* of each
  // called function capable of running on multiple threads efficiently.
