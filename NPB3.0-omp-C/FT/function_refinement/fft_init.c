    // Synchronization Note: When parallelizing the outer loop using OpenMP,
    // no explicit synchronization (like locks or atomics) is required for
    // writes to 'u' because each thread will be processing a distinct range
    // of indices ([current_ku, current_ku + current_ln - 1]) due to the
    // independent calculation of 'current_ku' and 'current_ln' per 'j'.
    // Variables like t, ti, current_ln, current_ku, and i are local to each
    // iteration/thread and should be made private in a parallel region.
