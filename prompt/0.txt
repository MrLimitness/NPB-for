Please follow OpenMP best practices to add/delete OpenMP primitives in the given C code. 
**Strict Requirements**:
1. Output **only** a .patch file in standard `diff` format, wrapped in ```patch code blocks.
2. Modify **only OpenMP directives** (add/delete `#pragma omp` clauses), do NOT alter other code.
3. Ensure line numbers and context lines in the patch are correct.
4. Make sure that the code generated by applying the patch is runnable.
5  Make sure that the added openmp primitives are genuine and valid.
