Please follow OpenMP best practices to add/delete OpenMP primitives in the given C code. 
**Strict Requirements**:
1. Modify **only OpenMP directives** (add/delete `#pragma omp` clauses), do NOT alter other code.
2. Make sure that the code generated is runnable.
3. Make sure that the added openmp primitives are genuine and valid.
